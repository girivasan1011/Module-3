# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## 🧾 Program
```
tuplex = input()
print("n" in tuplex)
print("8" in tuplex)
```

## Output
<img width="958" height="288" alt="438925524-4fc2820a-bb0f-4848-a5d6-05c526affdcf" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8d55bcf-9b9f-4264-8563-789dce46e531" />

## Result
Thus the program executed successfully.
